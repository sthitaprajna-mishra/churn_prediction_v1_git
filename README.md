This is a Flask app which performs ML operations on a bank's customer data and predicts whether a customer will churn or not. 
It also displays visualizations of the data, helping the user understand the impact of the features in the customer's decision making process. 
The user is also given a choice to input new data, on which the model will train and predict.
